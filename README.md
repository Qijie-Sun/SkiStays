# SkiStays
This project aims to develop SkiStays Euro, a web-based application for European ski lovers,
which helps users view the specifications of ski resorts in Europe and find lodging options
nearby. The available options will include hotels and Airbnbs. By combining datasets of ski
resorts, hotels, and Airbnb listings across Europe, the application would enable users to explore
detailed information of lodging options and create/share preferences as a group.

## Features
The primary way users interact with the application is through evaluating a series of ski resorts
recommended by the system. Users can first search for ski resorts near a certain location. They
can then use filters so the algorithm refines the recommendations based on their preferences. For
each ski resort, users can also favorite it and their preferred lodging option(s). Additionally, 
the application allows multi-user interaction by enabling users to create a ski group to share 
their desired ski resort, hotel or Airbnb.
