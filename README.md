# SkiStays
This project aims to develop SkiStays Euro, a web-based application for skiers in Europe.
Using SkiStays Euro, users will be able to view the specifications of various ski resorts in 
Europe and find nearby lodging options. The available options will include hotels and Airbnbs. 
Users are also able to favorite lodging options and share their preferences in groups.

## Features
The primary way users interact with the application is through evaluating a series of ski resorts
recommended by the system. Users can first search for ski resorts near a certain location. They
can then use filters so the algorithm refines the recommendations based on their preferences. For
each ski resort, users can also favorite it and their preferred lodging option(s). Additionally, 
the application allows multi-user interaction by enabling users to create a ski group to share 
their desired ski resort, hotel or Airbnb.
